"""Pythonic storage configuration grammar.

A ``genro-builders`` grammar that describes a storage configuration as a set
of typed, self-documenting method calls instead of a dict/YAML blob. One
``@element`` per protocol: the tag IS the protocol, so there is no ``protocol``
field anywhere — the adapter reads ``node.node_tag``. Each element documents
the mount from its own signature; required fields are the parameters without a
default, validated by the signature machinery (a missing one raises
``ValueError: Validation failed: required attribute ...``). ``permissions`` is a
``Literal`` so an invalid value is rejected by the same signature check.

The required fields mirror exactly those that ``manager.py:_configure_mount``
raises ``StorageConfigError`` on today; legacy aliases (``path``/``prefix``/
``base_url``/``key``/``secret``) are deliberately dropped — one name per field is
the point of the change.

The module ships the vocabulary and the dialect as two classes.
:class:`StorageGrammar` is a plain mixin carrying only the ``@element``
declarations, so a host document can mount it (``StorageManager.grammar``, whose
builder class ``get_subbuilder`` fabricates on first use);
:class:`StorageConfig` composes it with ``BuilderBase`` into the standalone
dialect ``configure()`` consumes. No element declares ``parent_tags`` — the
``mounts`` container's ``sub_tags`` is the only containment rule, which is what
lets one set of elements serve both shapes.

Every mount lives inside the ``mounts`` collection, keyed by ``name``: two
mounts sharing a name raise ``duplicate collection key``. Values that come from
outside the recipe — secrets, endpoints, deployment roots — are declared IN PLACE
as a ``BagResolver``: the fields that carry them are typed ``... | BagResolver``
and ``configure()`` resolves each one once, where the value lives, with no
datastore entry to pair a pointer with.

At-rest encryption is two fields: ``storage_key`` on the ``mounts`` collection
carries the key material for the whole recipe, ``default_encrypted`` gives a
mount the default of the per-write ``encrypted`` parameter. Encryption itself is
declared at the write site — the mount holds a default, never a state.

Example::

    import os

    from genro_bag.resolver import BagCbResolver

    class MyConfig(StorageConfig):
        def main(self, root):
            m = root.mounts(storage_key=BagCbResolver(lambda: os.environ["STORAGE_KEY"]))
            m.local(name="home", base_path="/srv/data")
            m.local(name="secure", base_path="/srv/secure", default_encrypted=True)
            m.s3(name="uploads", bucket="my-bucket",
                 secret_key=BagCbResolver(lambda: os.environ["S3_SECRET"]))
            m.relative(name="public", path="home:public", permissions="readonly")
"""
