# genro-storage

**Universal storage abstraction for Python with pluggable backends**

A modern, elegant Python library that provides a unified interface for accessing files across local filesystems, cloud storage (S3, GCS, Azure), and remote protocols (HTTP, SFTP). Built on top of **fsspec**, genro-storage adds an intuitive mount-point system and user-friendly API inspired by Unix filesystems.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🔌 **Powered by fsspec** - Leverage 20+ battle-tested storage backends
- 🗂️ **Mount point system** - Organize storage with logical names like `home:`, `uploads:`, `s3:`
- 🎯 **Intuitive API** - Pathlib-inspired interface that feels natural and Pythonic
- ⚙️ **Flexible configuration** - Load mounts from YAML, JSON, databases, or code
- 🧪 **Test-friendly** - In-memory backend for fast, isolated testing
- 🚀 **Production-ready** - Built on 6+ years of Genropy production experience
- 📦 **Lightweight core** - Optional backends installed only when needed
- 🔄 **Cross-storage operations** - Copy/move files between different storage types seamlessly

## 🤔 Why genro-storage vs raw fsspec?

While **fsspec** is powerful, genro-storage provides:

- **Mount point abstraction** - Work with logical names instead of full URIs
- **Simpler API** - Less verbose, more intuitive for common operations
- **Configuration management** - Load storage configs from files or databases
- **Enhanced utilities** - Cross-storage copy, unified error handling, helper methods

Think of it as **"requests" is to "urllib"** - a friendlier interface to an excellent foundation.

## 🎯 Perfect For

- **Multi-cloud applications** that need storage abstraction
- **Data pipelines** processing files from various sources
- **Web applications** managing uploads across environments
- **CLI tools** that work with local and remote files
- **Testing scenarios** requiring storage mocking

## 🚀 Quick Example

```python
from genro_storage import StorageManager

# Configure storage backends
storage = StorageManager()
storage.configure([
    {'name': 'home', 'type': 'local', 'path': '/home/user'},
    {'name': 'uploads', 'type': 's3', 'bucket': 'my-app-uploads'},
    {'name': 'backups', 'type': 'gcs', 'bucket': 'my-backups'}
])

# Work with files using a unified API
node = storage.node('uploads:users/123/avatar.jpg')
if node.exists:
    # Copy from S3 to local
    node.copy(storage.node('home:cache/avatar.jpg'))
    
    # Read and process
    data = node.read_bytes()
    
    # Backup to GCS
    node.copy(storage.node('backups:avatars/user_123.jpg'))
```

## 📦 Installation

```bash
# Basic installation (local storage only)
pip install genro-storage

# With cloud storage support
pip install genro-storage[s3]      # Amazon S3
pip install genro-storage[gcs]     # Google Cloud Storage
pip install genro-storage[azure]   # Azure Blob Storage
pip install genro-storage[full]    # All backends
```

- Modern Python (3.9+) with full type hints
- Zero dependencies for core functionality (fsspec installed on demand)

## 🤝 Origins

genro-storage is extracted and modernized from [Genropy](https://github.com/genropy/genropy), a Python web framework with 6+ years of production battle-testing. We're making this powerful storage abstraction available as a standalone library for the wider Python community.
